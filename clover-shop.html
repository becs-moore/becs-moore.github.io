                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        I designed a solution finder to guide small business owners—many unfamiliar with POS hardware—toward 
                        the right Clover devices and accessories for their needs. The tool asked simple, goal-oriented questions 
                        to surface tailored product recommendations, reducing overwhelm and increasing buyer confidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was part of launching Clover's first direct sales channel, where I also supported the overall /shop 
                        design and contributed to building the style guide. This work contributed to a measurable lift in Clover's 
                        top KPI: merchant accounts opened.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Shifting to a merchant-driven experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this launch, I made it easy for merchants to compare and shop for Clover devices. Merchants have 
                        the option to add hardware accessories and software integrations to customize their Clover system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked with the lead designer and stakeholders to map out the needs of different businesses and identify 
                        the most successful devices and add-ons for each vertical.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This data informed the questions that I needed to ask in order to correctly sort merchants by vertical 
                        and specific feature/payment needs. To keep users engaged, I streamlined the user flow and also created 
                        "off-ramps" to direct merchants to specialized apps in the Clover App Market. Merchants can also connect 
                        with the sales team if they require further assistance.

                    <h2>Designing a solution finder</h2>
                    <p>
                        On the /shop homepage, merchants are prompted to enter a full-screen lightbox and answer three to four 
                        simple questions about their business. Based on their answers, a primary and a secondary Clover device 
                        are recommended. To display detailed product views and a side-by-side comparison, I created a slider module. 
                        Any add-ons are highlighted below the slider module.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Slider module</h2>
                    <p>
                        This module was designed to address space constraints, making it easy for users to switch between 
                        individual product details and side-by-side comparisons without excessive scrolling. It can also be 
                        found on Clover Station landing pages, where it compares up to three devices.

                    <h2>Designing the details</h2>
                    <p>
                        A minimalist design, mobile-friendly considerations, and attention to detail with micro-interactions 
                        helped me achieve our project vision of conveying quality through design and performance.

                    <p class="prototype-note">
                        I used After Effects and Figma to create a prototype that illustrates and tests the interactions 
                        between recommended devices. The prototype is intended for desktop use, but the slider module is 
                        designed to be responsive and work across all screen sizes, with some limitations in the comparison 
                        view on mobile.

                    <p>
                        The launch of a new direct sales channel transformed our approach from sales-driven to merchant-driven, 
                        significantly widening the top of our lead generation funnel. By implementing strategic nurturing pathways, 
                        we successfully encouraged merchants to upgrade their software and add hardware over time. These initiatives 
                        directly drove our primary KPI, resulting in a measurable increase in merchant accounts opened.

                        mapping to understand user needs. I led wireframing efforts and UI design, creating prototypes for 
                        testing with users. I actively engaged in sharing updates and soliciting feedback from leadership 
                        regarding our design direction.
